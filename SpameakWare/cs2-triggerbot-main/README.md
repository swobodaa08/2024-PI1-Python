# Overview
CS2 TriggerBot is an automated tool designed for Counter-Strike 2 that assists with precise aiming by automatically triggering a mouse click when an enemy is detected in the player's crosshairs. The tool features a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy configuration.

## Features
- **Automatic Trigger**: Fires your weapon when an enemy is detected under your crosshair.
- **Configurable Trigger Key**: Configure a keyboard key or mouse button (`x1` or `x2`) as the trigger via the GUI or `config.json` file.
- **Configurable Delays**: Set minimum, maximum, and post-shot delays for more natural shooting behavior.
- **Attack Teammates Option**: Toggle friendly fire with a checkbox in the GUI.
- **Offsets and Client Data**: Automatically fetches the latest offsets and client data from remote sources.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs are saved in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\crashes\tb_logs.log`.
- **Update Checker**: Automatically checks for updates from the GitHub repository.
- **GUI Interface**: Control the bot's behavior and configuration using the included graphical interface.
- **Dynamic Config Update**: Automatically detects and applies changes to the `config.json` file without restarting the bot.

## Installation

You can install the trigger bot by cloning the repository or by downloading a pre-built executable file from the releases.

### Option 1: Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jesewe/cs2-triggerbot.git
   cd cs2-triggerbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Download Pre-Built Executable

Alternatively, download the ready-to-use executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/Jesewe/cs2-triggerbot/releases) page. Download the latest version and run the executable directly.

## Configuration
The `config.json` file is automatically generated in the directory `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\` on the first run. You can modify the `TriggerKey` in this file or via the GUI.

Example `config.json`:
```json
{
    "Settings": {
        "TriggerKey": "x",
        "ShotDelayMin": 0.01,
        "ShotDelayMax": 0.03,
        "AttackOnTeammates": false,
        "PostShotDelay": 0.1
    }
}
```

- **TriggerKey**: The key or mouse button (`x`, `x1`, or `x2`) to activate the bot.
- **ShotDelayMin** and **ShotDelayMax**: Control the delay between shots to simulate natural behavior.
- **PostShotDelay**: Set a delay after each shot for more controlled firing.
- **AttackOnTeammates**: Set to `true` to enable friendly fire.

## Usage
1. Launch Counter-Strike 2.
2. Run the TriggerBot using the command mentioned above or by launching the GUI version.
3. Adjust settings like `Trigger Key`, `Shot Delay`, `Post Shot Delay` and `Attack Teammates` from the GUI.
4. The bot will automatically start functioning when the game is active.

## Troubleshooting
- **Failed to Fetch Offsets:** Ensure you have an active internet connection and that the source URLs are accessible.
- **Errors with Offsets after Game Update:** After a Counter-Strike 2 game update, there may be issues with offsets, which can result in errors. In this case, please wait for updated offsets to be released.
- **Could Not Open `cs2.exe`:** Make sure the game is running and that you have the necessary permissions.
- **Unexpected Errors:** Check the log file located in the log directory for more details.
