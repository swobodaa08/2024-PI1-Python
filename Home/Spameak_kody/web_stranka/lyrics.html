            I rock like pebble, get jumped for your shit
            You hear this beat, uh, comin' like heavy metal, raow
            If you got a business, bro, please, set it in stone like rock, rock
            I came with a brand-new bottle
            Like, man have guys all shot, don't like Uzi, but this ting rocks, rocks, ro-ro-rocks
            Oi, I know you wanna hear some hi-hats, tit-tit tat to the tot
            Matter of fact, play that bass, don't disgrace, let it embrace
            I know you like this new taste, lick, don't let it go to waste, yeah
            Quick, come clean like mop

            Oi, see, this ting rocks
            Man had a-, man had a dreadful year
            That's the reason why I cut off my 'locs
            God tested me just like Mos'
            The K's were at trap like war
            Man's murkin' this just like Stormz'
            I don't even like my veg', why you talkin' 'round me 'bout corn, gang?

            If you're mad, say it with your chest
            I'm really tryna check mate (cough, cough)
            I'm tryna see what you're on, so I know that you're off
            You might as well start, just press play, and I'm quite cold
            Come in like a virtual cough, cah you're on the other side of the phone (brr, brr)
            If I don't like the base or the pitch of your tone
            I'm tellin' man, "Leave me alone, " gang (gang)

            I rock like pebble, get jumped for your shit
            You hear this beat, uh, comin' like heavy metal, raow
            If you got a business, bro, please, set it in stone like rock (rock)
            I came with a brand-new bottle
            Like, man have guys all shot, don't like Uzi, but this ting rocks, rocks, ro-ro-rocks
            Oi, I know you wanna hear some hi-hats, tit-tit tat to the tot
            Matter of fact, play that bass, don't disgrace, let it embrace
            I know you like this new taste, lick, don't let it go to waste, yeah
            Quick, come clean like mop

            Oi, My dog (my dog), this ting rot like Weiller (who?)
            You think you're fine, you ain't leng my friend, you ain't penger than Skylar or Tyla
            No, you ain't lenger than her (ya, ya)
            Can't wait 'til I get my whip and skrrt
            Or I get a diamond chain like, "Brr"
            Or I get a ting that screams, "Okurr" (okurr)

            Oi, me and bro come different
            I'm like summer, he's like winter
            Pay like TT flake, I just tell a man baked from all that sport
            Oi, look, why you tryna take that tone?
            Had a sweet one ask for my call
            And I was like, "No, I don't really use that"
            She-she wanna stick to the boy like glue tack (glue tack)

            I rock like pebble, get jumped for your shit
            You hear this beat, uh, comin' like heavy metal, raow
            If you got a business, bro, please, set it in stone like rock (rock)
            I came with a brand-new bottle
            Like, man have guys all shot, don't like Uzi, but this ting rocks, rocks, ro-ro-rocks
            Oi, I know you wanna hear some hi-hats (I know you wanna hear some hi-hats)
            Tit-tit tat to the tot
            Matter of fact, play that bass, don't disgrace, let it embrace
            I know you like this new taste, lick, don't let it go to waste, yeah

            Quick, come clean like mop
            Quick, come-, quick, come clean like mop
            Clean like mop, clean like-, clean like mop, mop
            Quick come, quick come clean like mop, mop, mop
            Quick come clean, clean, clean like mop, clean like mop, mop
            Quick come clean like mop, clean like mop
            Quick come, quick come clean like mop (clean like mop)
